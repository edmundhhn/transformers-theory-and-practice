# Automated Pricing for Sellers on Amazon Marketplace

## Overview
A major obstacle for the 9.7 million sellers on Amazon marketplace is the difficulty of setting a competitive price for their product. Accurately predicting product prices is paramount for maximizing profits and staying ahead of the competition, whilst incorrectly setting prices could lead to revenue loss through over/under selling.

Our solution harnesses the power of the Transformer (more specifically, the BERT) architecture to create an algorithmic pricer for products based on the product name, and its category. With this "rough" price in mind, the seller can immediately gauge a good understanding of what their product will sell for, without doing any market research.
